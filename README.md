# Indian Currency Coin Dataset

Indian Currency coin Dataset consists of 2200 images containing 4 folders of each different coin. 1 Rupee coin , 2 rupee coin, 5 rupee coin, and 10 Rupee coins with repect to it's folder. In order to access the dataset , one must download the zip folder of the dataset. And then one can extract that zip folder and access all the folders.
Currency recognition and classification is one essential task to do. Both paper and coin currency play important role in transactions in everyday life. But provided there are many datasets available of paper currency, and very less datasets are available of coin currency.  Coin currency recognition becomes important because even though the amount for which people do coin transactions is small but inaccuracy in recognition can lead to huge loss. 

##### Following are the objectives to create this dataset:
•	Create dataset of old and new Indian coin currency.
•	Dataset of good quality images.

This image dataset consists of 1907 images, having 4 classes: Re 1 coins, Rs 2 coins, Rs 5 coins and Rs 10 coins.
The images were taken by mobile phone’s rear camera. 
They were taken under different conditions like light differences, different backgrounds, also each class has different type of coins, for example 1re coin has 3 types of different coins based on its design and structure.
